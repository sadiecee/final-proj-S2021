## Final Project: Script 1
### Web-scraping Weather Forecast Information with Python
The goal of this first script was to scrape the 5-day weather forecast from the National Weather Service website. It extracts information listed in one class using BeautifulSoup, a common library for webscraping. It takes a user input latitude and longitude value to create a URL. From this URL, it prints an output of a well formatted five day forecast. 

In previous research, specifically with the geography program at Clark University, I had to extract weather data as part of my researching on tree cooling. While this was all done manually, being able to use a python code like this is something I could see using. Taking a series of lat/long values from an excel sheet to generate if not a full five day forecast, but weather conditions that are required variables to simulate different heating or cooling urban models, would be a code that could be helpful to future research along these lines. Additionally, because this script takes multiple elements from one class, it is a code that will be helpful in future cases to extract more than one piece of information from each class. 

## Final Project: Script 2
### Your Chosen Assignment
For this script, you will complete the assignment that you have proposed, which involves creating a new script, completing an online tutorial, or modifying a previous exercise or lab. You'll need to save that file or notebook into this repo: be sure to include comments and documentation in your script to tell me what it’s doing!

Script 2: clearly explain what you are trying to do! While your comment code will help someone reviewing the code understand what it does, youre write-up should expand on these an offer more detail about the overall goal of the script. Additionally, you should describe the process of writing the script: was it easy, hard, what challenges or errors did you face and how did you resolve them? If you use any resources to help write your code (e.g. Stackoverflow.com; the text book; etc.), please link to them in the body of your text. E.g. “After repeated syntax errors, I checked Stackoverflow.com to find that…” Use Markdown to format your text and link to a specific online resources that you used.


## Final Project: Debugging
Your write-up will be here, on this README page. You will need to edit this page with your new text: you do **not** need to keep these instructions on your README!
